            "q": "What is the Combstruct comb-beam system?",
            "a": "Combstruct uses patented comb-beam technology—interlocking wood-based panels (MFP or OSB-3) that form a universal load-bearing core for walls, ceilings, and roofs. Unlike traditional timber framing, our system requires no structural timber, concrete, or steel. The interlocking design creates beams of theoretically unlimited length and eliminates the need for lintels, cornices, or reinforcements."
          },
          "2": {
            "q": "How long does construction actually take?",
            "a": "Shell construction with full thermal insulation and airtightness takes 1-4 weeks—that's 3-10x faster than alternatives. Traditional brick construction takes 28-44 weeks, timber frame takes 12-20 weeks, and prefab takes 6-12 weeks. Our system requires only 4-6 labor hours per m², compared to 12-25 hours for other methods."
          },
          "3": {
            "q": "What types of buildings can be constructed?",
            "a": "The system adapts to any building type: single-family homes, multi-unit apartments, commercial spaces, offices, tenement superstructures (rooftop additions), and outbuildings. The uniform structural cross-section works identically for walls, ceilings, and roofs—no geometry changes between building elements."
          }
        }
      },
      "technical": {
        "title": "Technical",
        "questions": {
          "1": {
            "q": "What materials does the system use?",
            "a": "The core uses standardized wood-based panels (MFP or OSB-3)—no structural timber required. This makes us immune to lumber market price volatility. Insulation options include mineral wool, EPS, XPS, PUR, hempcrete, or pressed straw. Unlike timber frame construction, our wood-based panels support both open-diffusion and closed-diffusion insulators."
          },
          "2": {
            "q": "What thermal performance does the system achieve?",
            "a": "Our buildings achieve a U-value of 0.09 W/m²K—40-47% better than timber frame (0.16), prefab (0.17), or traditional brick (0.15). Airtightness reaches n₅₀ < 0.2 h⁻¹ at 50 Pa with spray membrane coating. This exceeds passive house standards as a default, not an upgrade."
          },
          "3": {
            "q": "What facade and finishing options are available?",
            "a": "The coffered core imposes no restrictions. Facades: ETICS systems, ventilated facades (fiber cement, HPL, sheet metal, tiles, green walls). Roofing: felt, PVC, TPO, EPDM, standing seam, metal tiles, shingles, green roofs, concrete/ceramic tiles. Interiors: standard drywall systems with a 45mm installation layer for plumbing, electrical, and smart home systems."
          },
          "4": {
            "q": "What is the building lifespan?",
            "a": "100+ years with proper maintenance. The system has zero thermal bridges, no hygroscopic deformation, and stable properties over time. The uniform cross-section from foundation to roof eliminates weak points found in hybrid construction systems."

            "a": "Yes. The system requires only 4-6 labor hours per m² and can be assembled by two people with basic power tools—no specialist qualifications needed. Traditional construction requires 18-25 hours/m² and specialized trades. Our detailed assembly guides and CNC-precision components ensure perfect fit every time."

          "1": {
            "q": "How does the cost compare to other methods?",
            "a": "Total cost: 2,600 PLN/m² including structure, insulation, and membranes. Competitors: timber frame 4,300 PLN/m², prefab 4,400 PLN/m², traditional brick 4,800 PLN/m². That's 45% savings—achieved by eliminating structural timber, concrete, steel, and reducing labor by 3-5x."
          },
          "2": {
            "q": "What's included in the base price?",
            "a": "All structural components (comb-beam panels), thermal insulation, membrane systems, and exterior sheathing. Windows, doors, facade finishing, interior finishing, utilities, and foundation are priced separately or included in full-service packages. Contact us for a detailed breakdown."
          },
          "3": {
            "q": "What about environmental impact?",
            "a": "Carbon footprint: ≤150 kg CO₂eq/m²—that's 4-5x lower than traditional construction (600-750 kg). Recyclability: 97% of components can be recycled or reused at end of life. No concrete or steel means the building can be fully dismantled and materials recovered, unlike conventional construction."

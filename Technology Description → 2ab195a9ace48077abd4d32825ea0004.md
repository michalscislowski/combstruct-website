# Comb Beam Technology

The comb beam is the basic element of the new construction technology covered by the patent. Its concept is based on the use of easy-to-process, standardised wood-based panels, such as MFP or OSB-3, and giving them a form that allows for independent assembly of a coffered load-bearing core for walls, ceilings and roofs. 

## Construction of a comb beam

The comb beam consists of repetitive sequences comprising:

- a straight zone – a full section with a length depending on the thickness of the beam,
- a groove zone – a section with a width equal to half the height of the beam and a length proportional to its thickness,
- end half-grooves – enabling the connection of successive beams into a continuous element.

In practice, a beam with a length of 250 cm, a width of 24 cm and a thickness of 18 mm has tongue zones with a length of 3.6 cm and a depth of 12 cm. This allows for precise fitting of multiple elements together.

## Construction of a coffered frame

Individual beams are used to create structural elements – pairs of adjacent beams whose grooves overlap, forming a continuous system. Thanks to the offset between the beam segments, it is possible to create a beam that is theoretically of any desired length. The principle of adding subsequent beams is shown in the figure below.

These elements are connected perpendicularly to each other, which allows for the construction of a coffered core. The principle of tongue-and-groove connection for perpendicular pairs of beams is shown in the figure below.

Such a core constitutes a universal load-bearing structure for walls, ceilings and roofs. Thanks to the interlocking of the grooves in both directions, the whole forms a stiffened coffered frame capable of carrying both vertical and horizontal loads. Regardless of the type of structure, the cross-section of the core is the same, as shown in the drawings below.

## Insulation

Thermal insulation is provided between the beams: mineral wool, EPS, XPS, PUR, hempcrete, pressed straw or other available materials. The whole structure can be covered with MFP or OSB boards, or fibre-cement boards, which not only stiffen the core, but also give the partition the required thermal and acoustic parameters. The filling between the coffers is shown in the photos below.

Thanks to the wood-based construction, both open and diffusion-closed insulators can be used - both polystyrene and wool can be used, which is a great advantage over construction with structural timber.

## Membraning

A coffered core made of comb beams can be membrane-coated using both traditional methods and modern spray polyurethane or polyurea systems. The choice of technology depends on design requirements, budget and installation conditions.

### Classic membrane

Standard vapour-proof, vapour-permeable or windproof films are used (e.g. typical roofing/windproof membranes with a weight of 90–140 g/m²). Installation is carried out by unrolling and mechanically fastening the films with tapes and staples directly to the core surface. 

### Spray membrane coating

It involves applying a seamless elastomeric coating (closed-cell polyurethane, polyurea or PU/PMMA hybrids) with a thickness of 2–4 mm directly onto the coffered core. The coating is sprayed on using a high-pressure unit, which ensures 100% adhesion to all geometric details of beams and grooves.

**Key benefits of seamless coating:**

- Elimination of thermal bridges and leaks at joints, installation passages and corners
- Actual improvement of the U-value of walls/ceilings by 12–18% compared to traditional membranes
- Full airtightness (n₅₀ < 0.2 h⁻¹ at 50 Pa) already at a thickness of 2.5 mm

Spraying creates a monolithic coating that transforms the coffered core into a closed, airtight box with passive parameters. The time required to apply a 200 m² spray coating is 4–6 hours (2 people + generator), which significantly speeds up the construction schedule compared to traditional membrane installation.

## Facade, roofing and window frames

The coffered core does not impose any material or technological restrictions.

**Facade**

- any system: ETICS (polystyrene/wool + adhesive + mesh + plaster)
- ventilated facade (board, fibre cement, HPL, sheet metal, slate, tiles, greenery), installation grid mounted to the core

**Roof covering**

- roofing felt, PVC, TPO, EPDM, standing seam sheet metal, metal roof tiles, shingles, thatch, sandwich panels, green roof, concrete and ceramic tiles

**Window and door joinery**

The coffered core eliminates the need for lintels, cornices and reinforcements, allowing for any location of window openings. The openings are cut freely and their vertical and horizontal dimensions are multiples of the system's technological pitch (41.6 cm).

## Interior finishing

The coffered core does not impose any technological or material restrictions.

- **Installation layer** (45 mm):
– complete freedom to install plumbing, electrical, mechanical ventilation and smart home systems,
– possibility of adding additional thermal or acoustic insulation (mineral wool, spray foam, high-density mats).
- **Internal cladding:** drywall system (MFP, plasterboard, OSB, fermacell or fibre-cement boards) with any type of finish – from filling and painting to decorative plaster, wood or ceramic cladding.

## Advantages of comb beam technology (Combstruct)

**Lowest material costs**

PLN 1,500–2,100/m² of usable floor space. 40–60% lower than in frame, prefabricated and brick technologies thanks to the elimination of structural timber, reinforcing steel and concrete.

---

**Minimal labour requirements**

4–6 man-hours/m². Three to five times less than traditional methods. Can be carried out by two people equipped with basic power tools, without the need for specialist qualifications.

---

**Shortest investment cycle**

Shell construction with full thermal insulation and airtightness in 1–4 weeks. Construction time reduced by three to ten times compared to the competition. Work independent of weather conditions and season.

---

**Cheapest transport**

Two TIR semi-trailers are sufficient to transport all the materials needed to build a house.

---

**Passive building parameters as standard**

Heat transfer coefficient U ≤ 0.09 W/m²·K. Energy efficiency improved by 40–47% with comparable partition thickness compared to frame, prefabricated and brick technologies.

---

**Full stability and predictability of parameters**

Uniform structural and insulation cross-section used from the foundation level to the roof. No change in geometry and materials between walls, ceilings and roof, eliminating the need for cornices, lintels and spacers required in other systems. Zero linear bridges, hygroscopic deformation and changes in properties over time. Consistent material consumption enables precise cost estimation, unambiguous energy calculations and native compatibility with BIM modelling.

---

**Complete independence from the construction timber market**

Use of wood-based panels and commonly available insulation materials only. No impact from fluctuations in the price and availability of structural timber.

---

**Lowest carbon footprint in the residential sector**

≤ 150 kg CO₂eq/m² for the entire building. Values 4-5 times lower than in masonry and frame technologies. Full compliance with EU taxonomy and 2026-2030 decarbonisation programmes.

---

**Closed material cycle**

97% of components are recyclable or reusable. Can be completely dismantled and resources recovered at the end of the building's life cycle, unlike concrete and mineral wool-based systems.

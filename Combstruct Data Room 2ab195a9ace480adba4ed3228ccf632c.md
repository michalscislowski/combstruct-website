# Summary

### **1. Description of the technology**

**Combstruct** technology is a patented prefabrication system for building structures based on wood-based panels (MFP, OSB). It allows for the creation of a **combined load-bearing core** for walls, ceilings and roofs — installed independently without the use of heavy equipment.

**Key features:**

- Modular tongue-and-groove system for quick installation without steel connectors.
- Standardised components → precision, repeatability and minimal waste.
- Integrated thermal and acoustic insulation (EPS, PUR, hempcrete, wool).
- Spray membrane option — creates a tight, seamless ‘passive box’.
- Uniform cross-section of walls, ceilings and roofs → no thermal bridges and no need for cornices.
- Suitable for walls, ceilings, roofs, superstructures, residential modules and halls.

### **2. Technological advantages**

✅ **Lowest construction cost** – from PLN 1,800/m² for materials and PLN 800/m² for labour

✅ **4–6 man-hours/m²** – up to 5× less than with traditional technologies

✅ **Shell construction in 1–4 weeks**

✅ **U ≤ 0.09 W/m²K** – passive standard without additional costs

✅ **Zero thermal bridges**, complete airtightness

✅ **No structural timber** → stable costs, no dependence on the timber market

✅ **97% recyclable components**, carbon footprint ≤ 150 kg CO₂/m²

✅ **Compliance with EU taxonomy** and 2026–2030 decarbonisation policy

### **3. Analysis of competitive methods**

| Method | Cost to build (PLN/m²) | Construction Time | U (W/m²K) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Combstruct (belka grzebieniowa)** | **2 600 PLN** | **1–4 weeks** | **0,09** |
| Szkieletowa | 4 300 PLN | 12–20 weeks | 0,16 |
| Prefabrykowana | 4 400 PLN | 6–12 weeks | 0,17 |
| Murowana | 4 800 PLN | 28–44 weeks | 0,15 |

**Conclusion:** Combstruct is a technology that is 40–60% cheaper, 3–10 times faster and twice as energy efficient as current methods.

### **4. The wooden house market in Poland (2019–2024)**

- The number of wooden houses increased from **708 (2019)** to **1,365 (2024)** according to the Central Statistical Office (GUS).
- In reality: **approx. 6,800 houses (2024)** – 5× more than the official data.
- Main players: modular prefabrication, frame structures, logs.

**Favourable factors:**

- Rising energy prices and pressure for energy efficiency.
- EU policy and support programmes (Fit for 55, KPO, REPowerEU).
- Boom in modular and mobile homes.
- Change in preferences of younger generations (ecology + speed of construction).

### **5. Market Forecast (Realistic Scenario)**

| Year | Timber Houses Built | Market Share | Growth y/y |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | 6 500 | 8,0 % | — |
| 2026 | 7 200 | 9,1 % | +10,8 % |
| 2027 | 7 700 | 9,9 % | +6,9 % |
| 2028 | 8 800 | 11,3 % | +14,3 % |
| 2029 | 10 300 | 12,8 % | +17,1 % |
| 2030 | 12 800 | 15,2 % | +24,3 % |

### 6. COMBSTRUCT revenue potential

Assuming 100 m² per house and market share growth to 5% by 2030:

| Year | Market Share | Sold Houses | Revenue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026 | 1 % | 72 | PLN 43.2 million |
| 2027 | 2 % | 154 | PLN 92,4 million |
| 2028 | 3 % | 264 | PLN 158,4 million |
| 2029 | 4 % | 412 | PLN 247,2 million |
| 2030 | 5 % | 640 | PLN 384,0 million |

Average gross margin: 57% (net profit approx. PLN 3,400/m²)

### **7. Product line**

1. **Holiday homes** – modules 35–70 m²
2. **Year-round homes** – 80–150 m²
3. **Semi-detached and terraced houses** – combined system with sound insulation
4. **Multi-family buildings (up to 3 storeys)** – reinforced coffered system
5. **Extensions to tenement houses and blocks of flats** – low dead weight, no concrete

### **8. Investment expenditure**

**CAPEX:**

- CNC machine tool – PLN 50,000
- Multi-blade saw – PLN 100,000
- Forklift truck – PLN 150,000
- Extraction systems and installations – PLN 15,000

**Monthly OPEX:**

- Hall rental (1,000–1,500 m²): PLN 25,000
- 8 employees (production + warehouse): PLN 120,000
- Energy: PLN 5,000
- Tool maintenance: PLN 2,000

Linear scaling: each CNC machine tool = 100 houses/year → new machine every 12 months.

Automatic production line planned for the turn of 2027/2028.

### **9. Synergy with MFP or OSB board manufacturers**

Synergy with MFP/OSB board manufacturers (e.g. Pfleiderer, Swiss Krono, Kronospan).

Potential for additional sales of **11,000+ m³ of boards per year (2030)** for the Polish market alone.
